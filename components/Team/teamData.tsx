Moving to the Broad Institute as postdoc, he honed his computational skills to harness existing cancer datasets to formulate hypotheses for rare diseases. Now leading the HTS team, he is excited to apply this experience in building the next generation of datasets. Mushriq is passionate about teaching and he's happiest when there's a whiteboard and a marker nearby.",
